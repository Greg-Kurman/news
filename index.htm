            <h1>How COVID-19 Spreads</h1>
            Current understanding about how the virus that causes coronavirus
            disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads is largely based on what is known
            about similar coronaviruses. COVID-19 is a new disease and there is
            more to learn about how it spreads, the severity of illness it
            causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States.
            <br />
            <h3>Person-to-person spread</h3>
            The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Between
            people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6
            feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person
            coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of
            people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

            <h3>Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects</h3>
            It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a
            surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their
            own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to
            be the main way the virus spreads.

            <h3>Can someone spread the virus without being sick?</h3>
            People are thought to be most contagious when they are most
            symptomatic (the sickest). Some spread might be possible before
            people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with
            this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the
            virus spreads.
            <h3>How easily does the virus spread?</h3>
            How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some
            viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while
            other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the
            spread is sustained. The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be
            spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community
            spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means
            people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some
            who are not sure how or where they became infected.

            <h1>Symptoms</h1>
            <h3>Fever / Cough / Shortness of breath</h3>
            CDC believes at this time that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as
            few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure. This is based on
            what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS-CoV
            viruses.

            <h1>Prevention & Treatment</h1>
            <h4>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</h4>
            <h4>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</h4>

            <h3>Stay home when you are sick.</h3>
            Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in
            the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and
            surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

            <br />
            <h3>Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.</h3>
            CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to
            protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.
            Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to
            help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of
            facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are
            taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health
            care facility).
            <br />
            <br />
            Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds,
            especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after
            blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not
            readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least
            60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are
            visibly dirty.
